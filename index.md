# My Current Projects

* [Building a 6502 Breadboard Computer (inspired by Ben Eater)](./projects/6502-breadboard-computer/index.html)

# How-To's

Here's a couple of ideas to get me started.

* Serial Monitor Options on Ubuntu (TODO)
* Programming PLDs on Ubuntu (TODO)

# Blog Posts

I don't have any lined up yet but here I will post links to any one-off topics that I feel a need to write about.  Most likely these will be related to projects I'm working on, personal interests such as wood working and astronomy.  Time will tell.

* Automation
* Personal Manifesto

# Past Projects

Eventually we'll get here...

# One last thing...
