# Why?

Documenting and promoting projects that I have been involved in has always been a weak spot in my skill set.  So what better way to improve this than start up a personal blog?  Although my motivations are perhaps also a little self-serving in another way since good documentation of things that I do means I always have a resource to look back on should I ever need a refresher.

While not always on the bleeding edge of technology, I do enjoy learning, so that has led me to pursue a variety of skill sets and technology stacks over the years as the needs of my projects allow.  The upside of this is work never gets boring.  The downside is I'm never truly an expert in any one thing, and sometimes it can be easy to mix technologies and need to refer back to references from time to time to straighten things out.  Keeps things interesting!

For now what I think I'll focus on is documenting things that I do for personal projects and perhaps on occasion make a blog post about some potentially unrelated topic that I'm currently interested in.

So if you find something of interest while you're here... great!  If not, then that's ok too.
