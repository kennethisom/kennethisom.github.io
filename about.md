# Why?

I haven't always been good through my career about documenting and promoting things that I have been working on.  So what better way to improve this than start up a personal blog?  Although my motivations are perhaps also a little self-serving since good documentation of things that I do means I always have a resource to look back on should I ever need a refresher.

While not always on the bleeding edge of technology, I do enjoy learning so that has led me to pursue a variety of skill sets and technology stacks as the needs of my projects allow.  The upside of this is work never gets boring.  The down side is I'm never truely an expert in any one thing and sometimes it can be easy to mix technologies and need to refer back to references from time to time to straigten things out.  Keeps things interesting!

So if you find something of interest while you're here... great!
